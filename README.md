# path-finding-algo-visualizer

## What the project does. 
During the `CS50 Introduction to Artificial Intelligence` course, I was particularly intrigued by the Week 1 content on search algorithms. I decided to apply my web development knowledge to visualize these algorithms, both as a learning exercise and to create something engaging. To further develop my skills, I implemented a path-finding algorithm visualization from scratch, using React, TypeScript, HTML, and CSS. This project, which also served as an opportunity to refine my React skills and explore TypeScript, was completed in 7 days, including research.


## Why the project is useful.
This single-page web application effectively visualizes four pathfinding algorithms: `Depth-First Search`, `Breadth-First Search`, `Greedy Best-First Search`, and `A*`. These algorithms are fundamental in computer science education and are crucial for understanding data structures and algorithms. By providing a visual representation, this application aims to enhance learning and engagement, offering an alternative to simply reading lines of code, which can sometimes be disengaging for new programmers.
