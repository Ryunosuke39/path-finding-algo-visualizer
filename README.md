# path-finding-algo-visualizer

## What the project does. 
During the `CS50 Introduction to Artificial Intelligence` course, I was particularly intrigued by the Week 1 content on search algorithms. I decided to apply my web development knowledge to visualize these algorithms, both as a learning exercise and to create something engaging. To further develop my skills, I implemented a path-finding algorithm visualization from scratch, using React, TypeScript, HTML, and CSS. This project, which also served as an opportunity to refine my React skills and explore TypeScript, was completed in 7 days, including research.


## Why the project is useful.
This single-page web application effectively visualizes four pathfinding algorithms: `Depth-First Search`, `Breadth-First Search`, `Greedy Best-First Search`, and `A*`. These algorithms are fundamental in computer science education and are crucial for understanding data structures and algorithms. By providing a visual representation, this application aims to enhance learning and engagement, offering an alternative to simply reading lines of code, which can sometimes be disengaging for new programmers.

## How user can get started.
You can access this web application from this link [link](https://path-finding-visualizati-acebf.web.app/).<br/>
### To visualize the algorothms:<br/>
1. Place a starting cell and a goal cell on the grid. <br/>
2. Select an algorithm from the Algorithm Type dropdown menu. <br/>
3. Click Start Path Finding to visualize the selected algorithm.<br/>
### Additional features:<br/>
Draw walls to create obstacles for the pathfinding algorithms.<br/>
Generate a random maze using the Generate Map button.<br/>
Reset Board to refresh the browser and clear the grid.<br/>
Clear Path to remove both the current path and the potential optimal path. Note that Start Path Finding will automatically clear any previous paths before visualizing the new one.<br/>
Cell to Goals displays the total number of cells in the possible optimal path. This may not always differentiate between algorithms, as the result can be similar depending on the maze structure, but it helps users understand and compare the pathfinding algorithms.<br/>
